# Release Instructions

Instructions for releasing a new version of these libraries to Hackage.

Note that the test/benchmark/tutorial packages should **not** be uploaded to Hackage,
since they are intended only for use within this repository:

- `proto-lens-benchmarks`
- `proto-lens-tests`
- `proto-lens-tests-dep`
- `proto-lens-tutorial/*`

## Prerequisites
- Make sure that the descriptors have been bootstrapped by running `runghc bootstrap.hs`.
- Make sure that each package's version number has been bumped and conforms to the PVP.
- Make sure each package's `Changelog.md` file is up-to-date.
- Make sure you are on a commit that has been merged upstream to `google/proto-lens`.

## Steps
For each package *without* autogenerated proto modules, simply run (from the root of the repo):

    stack upload {name-of-package}

Then verify that they've been uploaded successfully by visiting `hackage.org` in a web browser.

 
The rest (currently: `proto-lens-protobuf-types` and `proto-lens-combinators`)
are a little harder to upload due to #185.  Luckily we can upload them manually
with `cabal`.  First, install their prerequisites:

    (cd lens-labels && cabal install)
    (cd proto-lens && cabal install)
    (cd proto-lens-protoc && cabal install)

Then we can upload those packages the same way as any other Cabal package.  For example:

    cd proto-lens-protobuf-types
    cabal configure --enable-tests
    cabal sdist
    cabal upload dist/{path}.tar.gz

Finally, tag each uploaded package with its version and push it back to upstream.  For example:

    git tag -a proto-lens-v0.3.0.0 -m "Release proto-lens v0.3.0.0"
    ...
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:google/proto-lens.git
    git push upstream --follow-tags  # See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/26438076
