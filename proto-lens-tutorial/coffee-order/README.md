## Modeling Coffee Orders

We will examine what gets generated as the data and lenses for the definitions in [order.proto](./proto/src/coffee/order.proto)
which models some way of making coffee orders at a coffee shop.

### Coffee Types
The first thing we will look at is a way of modelling a sum type of different types of Coffees. The use of individual messages over an `Enum` was for a cleaner look to the messages.

Our set of Coffee types:
``` protobuf
message Americano {}
message Latte {}
message FlatWhite {}
message Cappuccino {}
message Mocha {}
```

### Coffee
Our actual Coffee message will be a `oneof` field containing our different coffees and also carries the cost with it:
``` protobuf
message Coffee {
  oneof coffee_type {
    Americano americano = 1;
    Latte latte= 2;
    FlatWhite flat_white = 3;
    Cappuccino cappuccino = 4;
    Mocha mocha = 5;
  }

  float cost = 6;
}

```

### Generated Code
These two sets of proto statements will be generated as follows:

#### Generated Records and Sum Types
``` haskell
-- Our Coffee sum type values
data Americano = ...
  deriving (Prelude.Show, Prelude.Eq, Prelude.Ord)

data Latte = ...
  deriving (Prelude.Show, Prelude.Eq, Prelude.Ord)

data FlatWhite = ...
  deriving (Prelude.Show, Prelude.Eq, Prelude.Ord)

data Cappuccino = ...
  deriving (Prelude.Show, Prelude.Eq, Prelude.Ord)

data Mocha = ...
  deriving (Prelude.Show, Prelude.Eq, Prelude.Ord)
```

``` haskell
-- Our Coffee type
data Coffee = ...
  deriving (Prelude.Show, Prelude.Eq, Prelude.Ord)

data Coffee'CoffeeType = Coffee'Americano !Americano
                       | Coffee'Latte !Latte
                       | Coffee'FlatWhite !FlatWhite
                       | Coffee'Cappuccino !Cappuccino
                       | Coffee'Mocha !Mocha
                       deriving (Prelude.Show, Prelude.Eq, Prelude.Ord)
```

To break this down, our proto types `Americano`, `Latte`, etc. are each turned into an (opaque) Haskell type.  Along with that, the `oneof` was generated as a `Maybe Coffee'CoffeeType`. Now, we did not specify some `Coffee'CoffeeType` but `proto-lens` generated it for us. This is the way a sum type is generated in `proto-lens` and as we can see it is our usual sum type with constructors around our original coffees `Coffee'Americano !Americano`, `Coffee'Latter !Latte`, etc. The reason it is wrapped in a `Maybe` is because it's possible for `oneof` fields to be unset -- or, equivalently, to be set to a case that is unknown by this version of the `.proto` file.

#### Generated Accessors and Prisms

Now that we have looked at the Haskell representation of the data, let's look at the lenses that come with these.

``` haskell
instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "maybe'coffeeType"
            (Prelude.Maybe Coffee'CoffeeType)
    where ...


instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "maybe'americano"
             (Prelude.Maybe Americano)
    where ...

instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "americano" (Americano)
    where ...

instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "maybe'latte" (Prelude.Maybe Latte)
    where ...

instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "latte" (Latte)
    where ...

instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "maybe'flatWhite"
             (Prelude.Maybe FlatWhite)
    where ...

instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "flatWhite" (FlatWhite)
    where ...

instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "maybe'cappuccino"
             (Prelude.Maybe Cappuccino)
    where ...

instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "cappuccino" (Cappuccino)
    where ...

instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "maybe'mocha" (Prelude.Maybe Mocha)
    where ...

instance Data.ProtoLens.Field.HasField Coffee "mocha" (Mocha)
    where ...
```

We have a bunch of lenses (or prisms) to access the data relating to `Coffee`. We can inspect the possibility of a `Coffee'CoffeeType` value in a `Coffee` value by using `maybe'coffeeType`. If we want to focus on a certain coffee within that sum type, for example `Mocha` we can use `maybe'mocha`. The word "inspect" is key here, we are viewing the possibility of values. So we if we used `mocha` for viewing a `Mocha` in `Coffee` we would end up with unknown data because it could be something entirely different, such as a `FlatWhite`.<br>

What we can use them for is setting values! When we are defining the value we will know (and have to know) what type our `CoffeeType` will be. Thus we can do the following, `defMessage & mocha .~ defMessage` where the second `defMessage` is secretly our empty `Mocha` value.<br>

As of `proto-lens-protoc-0.3.0.0` and later, `Prism'` functions are also available for use on `Coffee'Type` sum. The `Prism'` functions are of the naming convention `_Coffee'Americano`, `_Coffee'Latte`, etc. There is more information on `Prism'`s [here](../../docs/tutorial.md#oneof-generation)
